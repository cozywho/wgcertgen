wgcg.sh script is reliant on Wireguard being configured & installed.

wgcg.sh & ipspace.txt need to be in the same folder.

Modify the ipspace.txt file for your environment, keep same formatting.

showusers.sh outputs the same info as wg, but shows file names (usernames) instead of key data. Its currently pretty shit but..
