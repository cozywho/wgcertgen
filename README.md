wgcg.sh script is reliant on Wireguard being configured & installed.

wgcg.sh & ipspace.txt need to be in the same folder.

Modify the ipspace.txt file for your environment, keep same formatting.

Command should look like "sudo ./wgcg.sh username" and executed from within the same folder it resides in.
